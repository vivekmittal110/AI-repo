# airthmatic operator
1 + 2
1 - 3
4 * 5
9 / 3
4 % 3
2 ** 2
5 // 2 #2 answer round value
# all the airthmatic operator can be asigned with assignment operator
# example age += 5 # age = age + 5

# comparison operator
x = 5
y = 6

x == y
x >= y
x <= y
x != y
x < y
x > y
# these operators returns the boolean value

# logical operator
not True
False and True
False or True
# depends on condition is true or false

# identity operator
a = 10
b = 10
a is b # true
a is not b # false
# it checks whether two variables are pointing to same memory location or not.

# membership operator
"a" in "abcd"
"z" not in "abcd"

# ternary operator
age = 18
result = True if age >= 18 else False
print(result)
